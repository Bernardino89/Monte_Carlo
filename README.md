This repository contains the programs used to analyze the structures obtained from Monte Carlo simulations through the LAMMS software.

***average_MC_structure.py***     --> To compute the average structure from an MC simulation. Usage is shown in the program.
****bla_mc.py***                  --> To compute the average bond length alternation from an MC simulation. Usage is shown in the program.
****center_of_mass.py***          --> To compute the distance between the center of masses of monomers directly from an MC simulation. Usage is shown in the program.
****dipolar_moment_average.py***  --> To compute the average of the dipolar moment from an MC simulation. Usage is shown in the program.
****dist_SCF***                   --> To compute the distribution of the SCF from an MC simulation. Usage is shown in the program.
