This repository includes programs used for analyzing structures obtained from Monte Carlo simulations (LAMMS software).

****average_MC_structure.py***: Generates the average structure of an MC simulation. Instructions for use are provided within the program.

****bla_mc.py:*** Calculates the average bond length alternation from an MC simulation. Instructions for use are included in the program.

****dipolar_moment_average.py:*** Computes the average dipolar moment from an MC simulation. Instructions for use are provided in the program.

****dist_SCF:*** Calculates the distribution of the SCF from an MC simulation. Instructions for use are available within the program. 

****distance_com.py:*** Determines the distance between the centers of masses of monomers directly from an MC simulation. Instructions for use are detailed in the program.
